# Intro

Let's start to do a whole app using the Android Architecture components included in the Jetpack library. The application will be a Tweetdeck mobile implementation and initially it will contain only a login screen, the different lists of tweets and a setting screen.

## November 1th

We will try to add full navigation with the Navigation component.
